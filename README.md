KineMoe App created in TS/React.

On the landing page there the user is welcomed by a banner with movies, a title logo and a button to sign up/log in.
Under the banner there are different rooms, then comes the artists, a banner and the options to choose how do you want to use the app.

Sign up/Sign in page, here the user can log in if he has an account or sign up/register for a new one. If the user signs up first time he will be redirected to 9 steps that he needs to fill it for better experience.

Navigation is on the left side of the app and there are Profile button that leads you to the profile page, home button that lead you to the homepage, room button that on click opens up the rooms that the page offers, Movie room, series room, podcast room and kids room each of them leads to its page. Chat button that leads to the community page, Movie Hall and Settings.

On the homepage after loging in there is a carousel with movies, on top of it in the right bottom corner there is a slider with movies. On the banner there are buttons which are clickable and only the "Гледај" button works and leads you to the video player of the movie. Under there are sections with movies that you can scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel. On click on the movies you can see the movie overview page. There is shown the movie informations, comments for that movie. On clicking on the casts you are redirected to the artist overview page where you can see more about the artist.

Movie room is similar to the homepage but there is no movie slider on the banner.

Community page is page where people can discuss about a movie with comments, each comment leads to the comment page where you can discuss more in depth about each comment.

Video player page is simple video player with controls. It's not like all the other players, this one has a chat icon that on click and when the video is paused shows what other people has commented on the exact second and the user is able to leave a comment as well.
